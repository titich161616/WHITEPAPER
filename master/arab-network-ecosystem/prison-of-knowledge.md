# Prison Of Knowledge

### **Introduction**

Prison Of Knowledge is the first virtual reality platform powered by the Arab Network.

The prison of knowledge is a concept developed by Arab Network team with a vision of getting players into a world (the prison) where users will interact with the Arab Network ecosystem in a virtual world. Users may develop, enjoy, and monetize content and apps. The community permanently holds land in Prison Of Knowledge, providing them complete ownership over their works.

**Prison Of Knowledge**, unlike other virtual worlds and social networks, is not run by a centralized organization. There is no one person with the authority to change the laws of software, the contents of land, the economics of currency, or to prohibit others from accessing the globe.

### **Use Cases**

#### Education

Teachers from Arab Network Academy and students can meet regardless of their real-world location. Teachers can call upon their traveled knowledge to accurately inform their students.

**Digital Collectibles**

We anticipate that users will publish, share, and collect unique digital assets issued by their creators on the **Prison Of Knowledge** ecosystem. Users will trade these assets inside this world.

**Social**

Groups that now meet in online forums, chat rooms, or even centralized multiplayer games might move their communities to **Prison Of Knowledge**. Communities may also find a home in **Prison Of Knowledge**.

**Summary**

**Prison Of Knowledge** will be the first distributed virtual world platform that allows developers to build and commercialize apps on top of the Arab Network educational ecosystem. The scarcity of land on which to build apps produces hotspots that catch user attention, generating money for content providers. Arab coins will be used to acquire land, products, and services. Arab coins will also be utilized to encourage content production and user adoption, therefore launching the first decentralized virtual world in the Arab world.
