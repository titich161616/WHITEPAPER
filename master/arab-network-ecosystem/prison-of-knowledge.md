# Prison Of Knowledge

### **Introduction**

Prison Of Knowledge is the first virtual reality platform powered by the Arab Network.

The prison of knowledge is a concept developed by Arab Network team with a vision of getting players into a world (the prison) where users will interact with the Arab Network ecosystem in a virtual world. Users may develop, enjoy, and monetize content and apps. The community permanently holds land in Prison Of Knowledge, providing them complete ownership over their works.

**Prison Of Knowledge**, unlike other virtual worlds and social networks, is not run by a centralized organization. There is no one person with the authority to change the laws of software, the contents of land, the economics of currency, or to prohibit others from accessing the globe.

### **Use Cases**
