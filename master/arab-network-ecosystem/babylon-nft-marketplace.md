In its most basic form, this standard allows contracts that implement specified ERC interfaces to indicate a specific royalty amount that a creator or any right holder should receive whenever someone sells or resells their creations. This is the strongest standard available for any NFT marketplace aiming to support evolving NFT developers. By adopting this standard, Babylon allows creators to retain ownership of their artworks and projects while earning a resale royalty of up to 25%. Without a doubt, EIP-2981 has become the industry standard, allowing for the seamless transfer of royalties between markets.



#### NFT Swap <a href="#nftswap" id="nftswap"></a>

Collectors can use Babylon to trade one NFT for another, i.e. swap NFTs. Assume, as a user, that you want to exchange an NFT with a lower value than another NFT you'd want to have. In this situation, all you need to do is add value to your existing NFT, which may be in the form of a token.

Whenever a user proposes NFT swaps with another user, they must first authorize Babylon Marketplace to access their NFT so that when the user approves the swap, it is automatically processed. This request is saved in Babylon's database, and the other user is notified that there is a pending swap proposal. The other user might choose to reject or accept the exchange. If the swap is rejected, the platform cancels it, making it invisible and inaccessible to either user if there are no other matching NFTs available. If, on the other hand, the other user accepts the swap, you or the other user can then begin the swap procedure via the smart contract. It's fairly simple and slightly entertaining.
