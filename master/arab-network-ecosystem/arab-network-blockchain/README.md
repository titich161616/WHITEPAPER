# Arab Network Blockchain

**Abstract**

Cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms have taken over the mainstream however, due to limitations with scalability and user experience, they have failed to gain mass adoption. Even on Ethereum, the most actively used platform for smart contracts, few examples of DApps have experienced mass adoption. There have been a few examples where a single application momentarily gained many users, resulting in the network being crippled during periods of severe network stress. Yet, even the most advanced platforms aren't quite ready for widespread use.

Some smart contract platforms claim to be able to process higher transactions per second, but they sacrifice decentralization in the name of speed.

Aside from that, many of the upcoming solutions propose building their blockchains, completely ignoring the large developer community on platforms such as Ethereum.



Arab Network Blockchain is trying to solve problems with scalability and usability while not sacrificing decentralization and using the existing developer community and ecosystem to do so. It is a side-chain scaling solution for existing platforms that enables DApps/users to scale and give a greater user experience.
