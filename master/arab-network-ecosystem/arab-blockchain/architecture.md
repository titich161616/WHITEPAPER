**Introducing The Arab Blockchain**

**Arab Blockchain** combines the best of Ethereum and sovereign blockchains to give a full-stack scaling solution for public blockchains. &#x20;

The Arab Network Development team has already developed a user-friendly mobile app wallet and browser extension. Users will be able to pay, transfer, and hold crypto assets without concern for the underlying system's complexity.

## **Arab Blockchain Protocol**

### **How** Arab Blockchain is Such a Unique Blockchain? <a href="#why-is-algorand-such-a-unique-blockchain" id="why-is-algorand-such-a-unique-blockchain"></a>

**Arab Blockchain** has solved the blockchain trilemma challenge for crypto developers & creators: decentralization, scale, and security. You may now innovate on a solid foundation.

## **Noorseen Protocol**

**Arab Blockchain** uses Polygon Edge as a modular and extensible framework to build a sidechain Ethereum scaling solution by changing the consensus algorithms supported on Polygon Edge to our Permissionless mechanism called "**Noorseen Protocol"** that uses (Pure Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism. With blocks finalized in seconds, Arab Blockchain is the first blockchain to enable ultimate security, fast transaction finality, and low transaction fees on Ethereum.

## Decentralization <a href="#decentralization" id="decentralization"></a>

**Arab Blockchain** technology is completely decentralized, which means that there is no central authority or single point of control. Each block is approved by a special committee of users chosen randomly and in secrecy. Nodes are operated by entities from a variety of different countries.

#### Fair & Transparent <a href="#fair-transparent" id="fair-transparent"></a>

Control is distributed among all individual network participants

#### Secure <a href="#secure" id="secure"></a>

Fault-tolerant, having no special group that an attacker may target

## Permissionless <a href="#permissionless" id="permissionless"></a>

#### Public & Open to All <a href="#public-open-to-all" id="public-open-to-all"></a>

**Arab Blockchain** users do not require the approval of a trusted authority. Each participant has the ability to read every block and to write a transaction in a future block.

#### Low Cost to Participate <a href="#low-cost-to-participate" id="low-cost-to-participate"></a>

To join the **Arab** platform, you only need a little amount of computing power and a small amount of IT resources.

## **Consensus Mechanism**

### Pure Proof-of-Stake <a href="#pure-proof-of-stake" id="pure-proof-of-stake"></a>

**Arab Blockchain** is based on the Polygone Edge architecture and utilizes a decentralized Byzantine agreement protocol that uses a pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism. As long as the majority of the stake is held by non-malicious users, a system can reach consensus without the intervention of a central authority and tolerate malicious users. Users have a proportional influence on selecting a new block in proportion to their stake in the system (number of ArabCoins). Users are chosen at random and in secret to propose and vote on block proposals. Each online user has the opportunity to be selected to submit and vote.

### Rewards <a href="#rewards" id="rewards"></a>

In **Arab blockchain**, the power is in the hands of the stakeholders. Each user earns rewards proportional to their stake for each block added to the network. This is done to motivate people to join the **Arab** platform and accelerate our decentralization process.

## **ChainBridge**

**Arab blockchain** also allows connection with different blockchain networks, providing transfers of both [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20), [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721)**,** and other chains through a bridge solution.

ChainBridge is a modular bidirectional blockchain bridge that is compatible with EVM and Substrate chains. It enables users to send any type of asset or message to another chain.
