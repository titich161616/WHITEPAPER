Tokenomics are important&#x20;

Briefly, supply and demand are the names of the game with tokenomics. As with all assets, the smaller the supply and the bigger the demand, the higher the value.

Therefore, it is essential to understand the total supply of each cryptocurrency and how much of this supply circulates.

One billion ARAB tokens will be minted at genesis to operate the blockchain with an annual inflation rate that the community will determine by voting to reward node validators.
